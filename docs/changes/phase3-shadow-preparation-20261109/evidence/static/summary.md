## Evidence and remaining scope

- Host simulation does not verify physical PWM/LDOK, MCU timing, DMA races or vehicle/track acceptance.
- Hardware acceptance and manual ISR/DMA/critical-section review remain pending.
- GCC was explicitly selected for supplemental Host validation; MSVC /W4 /WX and ASan results are separate evidence.
- This run does not claim the complete PreFlash target-build/static profile.
